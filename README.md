# School_District_Analysis

### Overview of the School District Analysis

The purpose of this analysis was to find passing percentages of both reading and math scores from the file of students given, considering the situation that the reading and math grades for Thomas High School 9th graders have been altered. We decided to void them in order to prevent false information from interrupting our most accurate analysis by replacing them with "NaN". We then continued our analysis we did in the PyCitySchools.ipynb in order to determine whether those grades affected the overall analysis for Thomas High School and comparing it to the other High Schools.

### Results

There is a bulleted list that addresses how each of the seven school district metrics was affected by the changes in the data.
#### How is the district summary affected?
